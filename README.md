# Health Survey

This project is a COVID-19 related health survey that aims to provide a private, informative and intuitive app to participants. We collect the daily updates from participants and provide them with personalized recommendations as well as useful COVID-19 related resources. We believe a small change of this survey app could make a big difference and help you :)
